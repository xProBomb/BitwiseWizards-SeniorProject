Good:
	
Got a lot of large stories out of the way early
Able to get major parts completed that would be difficult to later
Communication and Teamwork
Updating others of progress

Bad:


Some people had too much on their plate
Some user stories had acceptance test dependencies on other user stories
Lack of pull requests
Total amount at once Merge conflicts


How we can improve:

Loosen up user stories to make them smaller and worth the correct amount of points
Ensure user story acceptance tests are accurate for single user stories
Consistently update dev branch when working sub-feature is completed
Regularly pull upstream when another dev makes pull request
