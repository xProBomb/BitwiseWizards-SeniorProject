# Sprint Retrospective

## Good:
- Got a lot of large stories out of the way early
- Communication and Teamwork
- Helped eachother resolve problems when possible
- Updated eachother of progress and important changes

## Bad:
- Some people had too much on their plate
- Some user stories had acceptance test dependencies on other user stories
- Lack of consistent pull requests
- Large number of Merge conflicts to resolve at once

## How we can improve:
- Break up user stories to make them smaller and worth the correct amount of points
- Ensure user story acceptance tests are accurate for single user stories
- Consistently update dev branch when working sub-feature is completed
- Regularly pull upstream when another dev makes pull request
